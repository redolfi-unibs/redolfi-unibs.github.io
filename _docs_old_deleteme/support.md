If you need help, you have a question, or you need further details on how to use
OWNER, you can refer to the following resources:

 - This [documentation web site](http://owner.aeonbits.org) 
 - The [GitHub issues](https://github.com/lviggiano/owner/issues) where you can
   post bug reports, request for features, questions, etc.
 - Telegram chat [OWNER API Users & Devs](https://t.me/ownerapi).
   
I suggest you to avoid writing to the project maintainer email address directly, 
since your email may be of interest for other users. So if you prefer email 
communication the mailing list is possible the best place where to ask, since 
other users and developers can read your questions and answer and benefit from 
them.

Anyway if you write to my email address directly I will do my best to help you.
